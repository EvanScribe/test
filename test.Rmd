This is the end of the first paragraph.

This starts the next paragraph.
However, putting a line right below it will not start a new paragraph.

*When you surround text with one-star pairs it becomes italicized*

**When you surround text with two-star pairs, it becomes bolded**

***When you surround text with three-star pairs it becomes both bolded and italicized***

1.  Start typing this list. Note there are two spaces between the period 
    and the word "Start".
2.  Type the second line of the list
1.  If I type step 3 as another step 1 it ignores it and still puts it as step 3.

*   This star creates a bullet point on the list.
*   Visually, it's similar to the numbered list.

1.  What happens if we nest a list?
    1.  Type four spaces, then type the number
    2.  This did what I expected.
2.  What if we contine the numbers this way?
    *   If we indent using stars it becomes a bullet point
    *   Let's add another one for good measure.
        *   We can get another level of nesting!
